        <h3> Html and CSS basics at <a href="w3schools">w3schools</a></h3>

        <p>I learnt HTML5 basics, I got to understand the basic structure of an HTML page and the funtions of the
          different componenents of it.</p>
        <p>I learnt CSS and its influence on the HTML5 page, how to apply it and things to look out for when de bugging
          it.</p>

        <h2>Intro to web at <a href="CodeSpace Academy">CodeSpace Academy</a></h2>
        <p>I gained understanding of what the internet is, how it came to be and most importantly the purpose it serves.
          I also learnt about the different tools that are used world wide by other programmers, such as VSCode,
          Git/Github, etc.</p>

      <p>I designed a game using the Scratch tool by MIT. The game has sold immensely worldwide and has a great rate of
        downloads.</p>
      <p>I worked with a senior developer, hence we constanly communicated which has increased my communication skills

      <h3>Junior Front-end Developer</h3>
      <p>I designed web pages using HTML mark-up language.</p>
